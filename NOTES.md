####advantages:
  * Eco- friendly 
  * Light weight
  * Sustainable material = low construction cost requirement.
  * Quick installation and/or de-installation (It just feels good to know we can have a house in a 21st century tech capability era, i.e 1 day). 
  * Economic value = base material is plywood, can be made from wood or bamboo(most prefered because of it rapid growth) which are also available locally. 
  * Community investment can go into the acquisition of CNC cutters/Laser Cutters/3d printers and other accessories and creating local cutting shops centers.
  * Design easy to replicate.
